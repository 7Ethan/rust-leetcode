Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of `O(log n)`.

If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```

Solution:

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn search_range(nums: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> Vec<i32> {
       if nums.len() == 0 {
            return vec![-1,-1];
        }

        let (mut left_most, mut right_most) = (-1 as i32, -1 as i32);

        // left
        let (mut low, mut high) = (0 as i32, (nums.len()-1) as i32);
        while low <= high {
            let mid = low + (high - low)/2;
            if nums[mid as usize] == target {
                if left_most == -1 || left_most > mid {
                    left_most = mid;
                }
                high = mid-1;
                continue;
            }
            if nums[mid as usize] < target {
                low = mid+1;continue;
            }
            if nums[mid as usize] > target {
                high = mid-1;continue;
            }
        }

        // right
        let (mut low, mut high) = (0 as i32, (nums.len()-1) as i32);
        while low <= high {
            let mid = low + (high - low)/2;
            if nums[mid as usize] == target {
                if right_most < mid {
                    right_most = mid;
                    low = mid+1;
                }
                continue;
            }
            if nums[mid as usize] < target {
                low = mid+1;continue;
            }
            if nums[mid as usize] > target {
                high = mid-1;continue;
            }
        }
        vec![left_most, right_most]
    }
}
