Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:

Input: 4
Output: 2
Example 2:

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

Solution:

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn my_sqrt(x: i32) -> i32 {
        let x = x as f64;
        let (mut a1, mut a2) = (1.0f64, 0.0f64);

        while (a1 - a2).abs() >= 0.1 {
            a2 = a1;
            a1 = (a1 + x / a1) / 2.0;
        }
        a1 as i32
    }
}
```
