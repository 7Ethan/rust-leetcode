Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.

Example:

```
Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.
```

Solution:

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn count_primes(n: i32) -> i32 {
        let mut flag = vec![true; n as usize];
        let max = (n as f32).sqrt().round() as usize;
        for i in 2..=max {
            if flag[i] {
                for j in (2 * i..n as usize).step_by(i) {
                    flag[j] = false;
                }
            }
        }
        flag.iter().filter(|&&b| b).count().saturating_sub(2) as i32
    }
}
```
